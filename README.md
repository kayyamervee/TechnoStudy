## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Installed on your system for writing and compiling Java code.

- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** Choose IntelliJ IDEA for Java development.

- **Git:** Installed for version control, it is essential for managing your project's source code on GitHub.

- **Selenium WebDriver:** Become familiar with its usage and basic automation techniques.

- **TestNG:** Understand its annotations and how to write test cases using this framework.

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Understand and implement this pattern in your test automation framework.

- **JIRA & ZEPHYR Test Management Tool:** If using the system, ensure access to and understanding of test case creation, management, and defect reporting.


## Project Requirements

**1. Page Object Model (POM):** Utilize the POM design pattern for structuring the test cases.

**2. Parallel Testing:** Execute tests in parallel on multiple browsers (Chrome and Firefox).

**3. XML Configuration:** Run test cases from an XML file.

**4. Smoke and Regression Testing:** Separate XML files for smoke and regression test cases.

**5. Live Environment Considerations:** Use "test" in the name and email fields to facilitate data cleanup post-testing, and set the country to "Argentina".
